Started the morning with a short walk 🏃‍♂️ — trying to build the habit again.  
Reviewed some older notes and noticed a few gaps → need to backfill references.  
- [x] Refactor the weekly summary template  
    - [x] Add section for quick wins  
- [x] Capture reading notes from last night

Coding went pretty well: spent ~45 minutes sketching out a CLI tool to parse daily notes and extract task stats.  
- [ ] Decide on file naming convention for exports
- [x] #project Write tests for parser

Evening plans: read a chapter from the new book 📚 and prep tomorrow’s agenda.
Feeling a bit scattered but overall productive.
