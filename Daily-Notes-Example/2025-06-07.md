Rough night — only ~6 hours of sleep. Focus rating felt like a 2/5: mind wandered a lot, hard to get into flow.

Still managed a short 20-min walk to reset a bit.  
Morning coding block stretched to 50 mins but felt scattered:
- [x] Refactor part of parser that handles frontmatter
- [x] #project Draft doc on why we track `exercise` & `code-mins`

Midday realised I keep forgetting quick ideas, so:
- [x] Create `Scratchpad.md` for random thoughts
    - [x] Add daily link to template
    - [x] Set shortcut in launcher

Afternoon:
- [ ] Review last week’s notes for missing tags
    - [ ] Fix orphan notes

Evening reflection:
Adding `focus-rating` helps capture days like this; feels honest.  
Might also note “reason” when it’s low: today it’s clearly sleep.

Plan for tomorrow: earlier night, simple morning routine, small coding win.
Ending today feeling tired but glad some tasks still moved forward.
