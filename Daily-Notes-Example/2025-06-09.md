Barely slept (about 5 hours) and skipped both exercise and coding — the first day in a while with zeros in both.  
Focus was practically non‑existent (rating 1/5).  

Spent most of the morning just fighting the fog; couldn’t even open the editor properly.  
Let the day go intentionally quiet instead of forcing it — felt oddly freeing.  

Read a few pages of an unrelated book, watched the rain, and tried to just notice thoughts rather than write them down.  
In the evening, finally opened the vault but didn’t add tasks — decided to keep today as a pure reflection.  

Funny how tracking even a “zero” day still feels like progress; it’s honest, and it’s part of the story.  
Tomorrow: don’t expect magic, but do aim for even 5‑10 mins of movement.
