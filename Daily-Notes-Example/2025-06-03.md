Quick walk in the morning; felt good to stretch.  
Short coding block: started a helper script to clean old daily notes.
- [x] Finish deduplication logic  
- [x] #project Add logging

Afternoon: reviewed backlog and realised some small things keep slipping:
- [x] Move recurring tasks into a weekly review
    - [x] Test new task query block

Feeling low on energy, so keeping today light. Aim for an earlier night.
