Added two new fields to the metadata:  
- `sleep-hours` → want to see how sleep correlates with mood & output  
- `focus-rating` → quick subjective score (1–5) to capture how focused the day felt

Morning walk helped shake off the grogginess after only ~6.5 hours of sleep.  
Coding block was shorter than planned, but got a bit done:
- [x] #project Finish CLI help text
- [x] Write small doc on install instructions

Midday, tried sketching an idea to automate part of the weekly review:
- [ ] Build small script to aggregate daily `code-mins` + `exercise`

Also noticed my tagging is drifting again:
- [x] Audit yesterday’s notes
    - [x] Fix missing `#project` tag on two items

Reflection: focus felt about a 3/5 — distractions kept creeping in.  
Need to protect that first 2-hour block tomorrow.
Ending the day with a quick tidy of the notes & inbox.
