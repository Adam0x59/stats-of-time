Woke after about 7 hours of sleep; mood is cautiously optimistic, energy medium‑high.  
Quick 25‑min walk + stretch — actually felt it clear out the morning fog.

Focus rating felt around 4/5 today; fewer distractions.

Morning coding block (50 mins):
- [x] #project Write helper: auto‑add daily link block if missing
- [x] Add check for `focus-rating` validity
    - [x] Value must be 1–5
- [ ] Refactor parser for clarity

Midday notes:
- [x] Tag last week’s entries with `energy-level`
- [x] Draft small post: “Notes aren’t data — they’re context”

Afternoon:
- [ ] Review open tasks tagged #task but no due date
    - [x] Decide: keep, assign, or archive

Reflection:
- Realised the numbers only help because of what surrounds them.
- The text tells why the numbers matter.

Tomorrow:
- Try splitting coding into two shorter blocks rather than one long
- Keep exercise streak alive (even short walk counts)

Closing out:
- Still feel some background tension but lighter than earlier in the week.
- Writing this reflection helps see the bigger arc, not just today’s noise.

Ending the day with a small sense of progress — enough to build on tomorrow.
