Slept better — about 8 hours — but still struggled to get moving. Focus rating just 2/5: brain felt muddy.

No exercise today; didn’t even get outside. Opened the code editor briefly (10 mins) just to keep the streak alive, but didn’t commit anything real.  

Spent the morning tidying notes instead of building anything new. Afternoon drifted by in slow reading and a bit of daydreaming.  

Noticed that quiet days often bring small insights in the gaps: like realizing the daily template itself can become a burden if it feels too heavy.  

Decided to let today stay light, without forcing lists or structure.  
Interesting contrast: low output, but not low awareness.

Reflection: maybe tracking these “barely showed up” days is as important as the productive ones. It keeps the story honest and human.

Ending the day quietly, planning nothing big for tomorrow — just to see what naturally wants to happen.
