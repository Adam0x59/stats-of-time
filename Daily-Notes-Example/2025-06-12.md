Woke up after only ~6 hours of sleep, mood slightly tense and energy somewhere around medium. Focus rating a shaky 3/5.

Started the morning with a short 20‑min stretch + walk just to clear the head. Even so, mind kept circling back to half‑finished tasks.

Dove into code early: 85 mins before lunch. Felt productive but scattershot.
- [x] #project Refine front‑matter parser → better handle missing fields
- [x] Automate adding `energy-level` based on quick prompt
- [x] Write short doc on why we track: “Context > numbers”

Noticed the script skips files older than 30 days — added comment to revisit.
- [x] Decide if that cutoff still makes sense

Mid‑morning, jumped between two projects:
- [ ] Quick note cleanup (renamed ~12 files)
- [ ] #task Identify files missing daily links

Focus dipped hard by noon — caffeine probably wore off.

Afternoon:
- [ ] Review pending merges (left one as draft)
- [ ] Sketch idea for weekly heatmap:
    - [ ] x‑axis: date
    - [ ] y‑axis: `energy-level` vs `focus-rating`
    - [ ] color by `code-mins`

Evening reflection:
- Energy feels fragmented; suspect shorter sleep + context switching.
- [ ] Write note: “Task batching vs parallel scatter”

Caught a small insight: days when I write narrative in daily notes feel less scattered, even if task count stays high.

Tomorrow:
- Try writing reflection *before* first task block
- Keep coding chunked (aim for two ~40‑min blocks instead of a long sprawl)

End of day:
- Mood softened from tense to neutral after review.
- Energy still medium but steady.

Realised again: it’s okay to show up imperfectly; these notes catch the shape of the day, not just the numbers.  
A small record of tension, choices, and gentle course corrections.

Closed vault at 22:15, tea in hand, brain finally slowing down.
