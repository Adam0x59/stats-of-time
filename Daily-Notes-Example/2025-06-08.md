Better sleep (~7.5 hours) really helped — focus rating about 4/5.  
Morning started with a longer 35‑min walk; tried leaving phone at home to stay present.

Quick planning session:
- [x] Review upcoming deadlines
- [x] Break bigger items into next actions

Coding block (45 mins):
- [x] #project Add `focus-rating` field to weekly summary
- [x] Fix small parsing bug: skipped days with missing tags

Afternoon reflections:
- [x] Draft note on “workflow friction points”
    - [x] Tag as `#meta` for later review

Noticed daily notes keep getting longer; might need a summary section.
- [ ] Experiment with collapsible “details” block
- [ ] Test if that keeps note readable

Evening:
- [x] Quick backup of vault to external drive
- [ ] Tidy `Inbox.md` → archive old ideas

Reflection: days feel more balanced when I get movement + coding early.  
Tomorrow: aim to repeat same structure & check how mood tracks.

Ending with tea & small review of the week so far.
