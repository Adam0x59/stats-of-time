Slept about 6.5 hours — woke still tired, mood feels “tired but steady,” energy pretty low.  
Focus rating around 2/5; noticed myself drifting a lot.

Short walk (10 mins) just to move. Didn’t help much but better than skipping.

Morning coding: ~35 mins:
- [x] #project Check parser against sample vault
    - [x] Test missing metadata field detection
- [x] Add optional prompt for `mood` if blank

Midday review:
- [ ] Tag previous week’s daily notes with `energy-level`
- [ ] Draft note: “Why track even low‑energy days?”

Reflection:
- Hard days feel pointless in the moment, but the pattern only shows over months.
- Logging low‑energy days stops the data from lying.

Evening:
- [x] Quick tidy in vault (archived 4 old notes)
- [x] Write single‑sentence summary of today

Tomorrow:
- Aim for slightly earlier bedtime
- Even 10 extra mins coding would help keep the streak

Ending with a sense of acceptance: not every day moves things forward in visible ways. Some days just get recorded — and that still matters.
