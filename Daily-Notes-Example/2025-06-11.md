Woke after 7 hours of sleep — mood feels balanced, calm but motivated. Focus rating around 4/5.  
Morning started with a 30‑minute walk in cool air, no headphones — letting thoughts drift freely.

Coding session stretched to about 70 mins:
- [x] #project Refactor file‑naming logic → handle edge cases with missing dates
- [x] Update documentation to match new fields: `mood`, `sleep-hours`
- [x] Test script for daily summary aggregation
    - [x] Fix unexpected off‑by‑one issue in date calculation

Mid‑morning brainstorm:
- [x] Sketch idea for “energy vs output” graph over week
    - [x] Needs `exercise`, `sleep-hours`, `focus-rating`

Reflected on why these numbers matter: it’s less about forcing productivity, more about noticing patterns that slip by day‑to‑day.  
Example: days with balanced mood often follow a walk + code session, even if short.

Afternoon admin:
- [x] Clear inbox of flagged notes older than a week
- [x] Decide whether to archive or re‑tag

Took a quick break — read an article on habit decay. Noted:
- [x] Draft evergreen note on “fragile vs resilient habits”

Evening review:
Realised small tasks accumulate mental load:
- [x] Add “quick wins” section in template to list sub‑5‑minute items

Also thought about balance: some days can’t be “high‑output,” and logging mood helps see why.

Tomorrow:
- Aim for ~40 mins coding
- Try earlier walk
- Keep mood tracking consistent

Ending today grateful for a steady pace instead of forcing a sprint.  
Not perfect, but feels sustainable — and maybe that’s the point.
