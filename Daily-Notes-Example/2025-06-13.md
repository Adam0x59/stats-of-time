Slept around 7 hours; mood feels calm, energy‑level medium but steady.  
Quick 15‑minute stretch + walk to start the morning helped clear leftover fog.

Focus rating ~3/5 today — kept slipping into side thoughts but caught myself.

Coding session about 40 mins:
- [x] #project Test front‑matter field defaults
- [x] Add helper to flag missing `energy-level` or `mood`

Took a short break midday to sketch new weekly review template:
- [x] Add “three highlights” and “one lesson learned”

Noticed how tracking even light exercise days keeps baseline mood steadier.  
Reflection:
- These notes aren’t about chasing numbers — they’re about keeping the story alive.
- The real value shows up over weeks, not single days.

Evening:
- [ ] Tag older daily notes with new fields
- [ ] Quick vault cleanup: remove duplicate backlinks

Planning tomorrow:
- Aim for slightly longer code block (50–60 mins)
- Keep walk habit consistent

Closing out with a sense of gentle progress rather than urgency. That feels worth keeping.
