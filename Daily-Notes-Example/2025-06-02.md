Slow start this morning. Slept badly, woke up late, and skipped exercise.  
Coffee ☕ helped, but mind still foggy.

Spent some time brainstorming how to improve the weekly dashboard:
- [x] #project Automate pull of `code-mins` stats from daily notes
- [x] Create chart for exercise streak  
    - [x] Add fallback if data missing

Midday, checked in on side project:
- [x] Review yesterday’s commits
    - [x] Confirm `refactor/main` branch is clean
- [ ] #project Add task to document install instructions

Tried to catch up on reading backlog. Highlighted a few quotes but didn't process them into notes yet:
- [ ] Import highlights into Obsidian
    - [x] Summarise key takeaways
    - [ ] Link to related ideas

Evening reflection:
Noticed that skipping the walk makes everything feel slower. Need to protect that morning habit.  
Also realized I haven't been tracking quick thoughts → going to create a scratchpad note:
- [x] Set up daily scratchpad
    - [x] Add it to daily template
    - [ ] Test quick capture shortcut

Tomorrow’s plan: keep it simple. Just walk, code 30 mins, and read 10 pages.

Ending the day feeling more grounded after journaling.
