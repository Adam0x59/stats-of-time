Early start today — got up around 6:30, did some light stretching and then went for a brisk 30-min walk 🚶‍♂️. Felt good to actually get moving before sitting down at the desk.

Morning block was all about catching up on notes:
- [x] Backfill last week’s meeting notes
- [x] Tag new entries properly
    - [x] Check consistency with `#project` tag
    - [x] Link to relevant high-level notes

Spent ~60 mins coding: refactoring the script that pulls stats from daily notes.
- [x] #project Add unit tests for new parser logic
- [ ] Handle edge case: missing `code-mins` frontmatter
- [x] Write small README so future me understands what this even does

Afternoon:
Deep-dive on the dashboard idea — tried sketching out what the weekly summary could look like.
- [x] Draft weekly template
    - [x] Include task completion rate
    - [x] Graph for exercise minutes
    - [x] Quick notes section
- [ ] Automate generation using Templater
- [x] #project Figure out how to exclude days without data

Realised I’m missing a proper place for random thoughts & half-baked ideas.
- [x] Create `Inbox.md` or similar scratchpad
    - [x] Add link to daily template
    - [x] Try quick capture hotkey

Evening reflection:
Feeling like the workflow is slowly coming together, but noticed some friction:
- Some notes are tagged inconsistently → leads to broken queries
- Weekly review process feels manual → maybe automate summary blocks

Action items for tomorrow:
- [ ] Audit tags across last month’s notes
- [x] Finish draft of weekly template & test it
- [ ] Go through backlog and close out quick wins

Other notes:
Had a random idea about visualising “time spent on habits” vs “output” — might try building a graph later.

Overall mood: calmer, more in control. Morning exercise makes a big difference.
Ending the day with tea & a short reading session 📖.
